# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to help **microfinance institutions** predict the likelihood of loan default based on customer financial and demographic data. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, this project demonstrates ML, explainability, and deployment in a real-world context.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Loan default can severely affect microfinance institutions' sustainability. This system helps identify high-risk applicants before issuing loans, reducing **non-performing loans (NPLs)** and supporting better financial decisions.

## 📊 Features
- Interactive **Streamlit Web App**
- Predict default risk from user input
- Model explainability with SHAP
- Visual analytics dashboard (Plotly)
- Clean and production-ready code

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Outlier detection  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., debt-to-income ratio)  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms: XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM  
   - Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall  

3. **Model Explainability**  
   - SHAP values to interpret predictions  
   - Transparent decision support for credit officers  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Streamlit interface  
   - Real-time user input  
   - Data visualization with Plotly
